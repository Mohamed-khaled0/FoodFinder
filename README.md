# FoodFinder

FoodFinder is an iOS app that utilizes CoreML and Vision frameworks to detect objects in images captured from the camera or selected from the photo library. It helps users identify various food items by analyzing the images and displaying the name of the detected food item.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes a pre-trained CoreML model to detect objects in images.
- **Camera Access:** Allows users to access the device's camera to capture images in real-time.
- **Photo Library Integration:** Users can also select images from the photo library for object detection.
- **Dynamic UI:** Displays the name of the detected object dynamically on the screen.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your iOS device.
2. Grant camera access permission if prompted.
3. Choose the option to take a photo or select from the photo library.
4. If using the camera, aim at the object you want to identify and capture the image.
5. Wait for the app to process the image.
6. The app will display the name of the detected object on the screen.

## Model Information

The app utilizes the Inceptionv3 model provided by Apple's developer website. Inceptionv3 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the ImageNet dataset for image classification tasks.

- Model: Inceptionv3

## Technologies Used

- **Swift:** The primary programming language used for iOS app development.
- **CoreML:** Apple's machine learning framework used for integrating machine learning models into iOS apps.
- **Vision:** Part of the CoreML framework, Vision provides image analysis and processing capabilities.
- **UIKit:** The framework used for building the app's user interface.
